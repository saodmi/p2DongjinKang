## **Pros vs. Cons with the Current Designs and Explanation Why it is Good vs. Bad**

Here are five examples of vehicle dashboards: Each dashboard contains a tachometer, speedometer, fuel indicator, lighting signal, ambient temperature and engine temperature that should be fitted to the vehicle by default. Figure (1) shows a mandatory warning indicator on a slightly older vehicle instrument cluster. The advantages of Figure (1) are the very large design of tachometers, speedometers and fuel indicators. Designed to stand out when the driver is looking at the instrument cluster. However, the overall size of the instrument panel is too large to look clean. One head light shows only the up sign, no down mark and does not indicate engine temperature. It is also regrettable that the cumulative distance meter (ODO), which represents the total mileage, is displayed as a small display under the speedometer.

Figure (2) shows a cruise indicator that was not present in Figure (1) with a dashboard of a model vehicle newer than Figure (1). By default, the vehicle's dashboard consists of a tachometer, a small engine thermometer and two large instruments with fuel indicators. The advantage of this dashboard is that it is not clean and messy. The size of the device has been changed to give the driver a quick, at-a-glance view of the entire dashboard. It is also good that it can check functions such as time and Bluetooth through intermediate LCDs. However, the speedometer's fuel mark is too small to be seen, which may cause the driver to forget the fuel condition.

Figure (3) shows the dashboard on a hybrid vehicle. There are two large tachometers and speedometers with engine thermometers and fuel markings as shown in Figure (2). Unlike Figure (2), however, the engine thermometer and fuel indicator are configured inside the tachometer and the LCD display shows the electric battery fuel in the middle. The advantage of this vehicle dashboard is that it shows a very simple tachometer, engine thermometer and fuel display. In particular, the engine thermometer and fuel indicators are displayed on the bar graph, not on the existing snow-prohibited chart, which makes them look cleaner. In addition, important warning indicators can be placed separately under the LCD display to identify major vehicle problems. The speedometer was expressed in miles and kilometers, considering the various units used in each country. However, it seems that it will have difficulty calculating fuel by marking the state of electric battery and the state of fuel separately. It would be better if the two fuel conditions were marked together to make it easier to see. It would also have been easier for the driver to identify functions such as Bluetooth on the LCD display or to display the fuel condition, road speed, and engine temperature once more.

Figures (4) and (5) consist of two speedometers, a tachometer, and a central LCD display. The difference from the previous figures is that the speedometer and the tachometer do not have a fuel indicator and an engine thermometer and are configured in the middle LCD display. So, when the driver looks at the dashboard, only the speedometer and the tachometer can be concentrated. The important warning indicators were placed separately under the LCD display, and the LCD display displayed fuel indicators and engine thermometers with bar graphs. The good thing about these two vehicle dashboards is that each instrument panel and indicator light are not intertwined. Each instrument panel and indicator light are arranged separately, making it easy to distinguish and neat to see when looking at the dashboard. In particular, it seems very good that the LCD display shows the figures once more.


## **Most common of The Car Dashboard**

The most basic functions include Emergency light, air bag warning light, safety belt warning light, brake warning light, ABS warning light, engine warning light, charging warning light, engine oil warning light, low pressure tire warning light, ESC light, head light, fog light and cruise light. The listed function lights are the most common and important indicators. Cruise functions may not have many vehicles, but most vehicles these days have this function.

To briefly describe these functions below:
- Emergency light: Lights up when various problems occur with warning lights.
- Air bag warning light: If the airbag warning light is illuminated for 6 seconds with the start on and continuously illuminated afterwards, it is an abnormal signal for the airbag device.
- Safety belt warning: If you don't wear your seatbelt after sitting in your seat, the warning light he audible warning will be activated.
- Brake warning light: When the parking brake is locked, the corresponding warning light appears, and if the start is started with the release, the corresponding signal is extinguished after three seconds.
ABS warning light: A warning light associated with a special brake function to prevent the wheels from locking when the vehicle brakes rapidly.
- Engine warning light: The warning indicator illuminates when the engine electronic control unit that controls the normal operation of the engine or various sensors associated with exhaust gas control have failed.
- Charging warning light: It is a warning light that most drivers know. Illuminates when the battery is discharged, or the fan belt is broken, and the charging device is malfunctioning.
- Engine oil warning light: This is a warning light that can be seen if the engine oil has not been changed for a long time. It is mainly lit when the hydraulic pressure is lowered due to lack of engine oil.
- Low pressure tire warning light: TPMS stands for Tire Pressure Measurement System, which measures tire pressure and temperature data and transmits information to the vehicle's instrument cluster and is illuminated when tire pressure is very low.
- ESC light: ESC is a body posture control device that controls the ABS function as well as engine torque to help maintain the vehicle's posture in an emergency.
- Head light: When the light switch is placed up or the light switch is pulled in the driver's direction, the up-light is lit and the corresponding light is illuminated.
- Fog light: When the fog light is on, the light illuminates.
- Cruise light: The indicator light illuminated using the cruise control function.


## **Rarer uses of The Car Dashboard**

Rare functions include Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) warning light, Motor-Driven Power Steering (MDPS) warning light, Mode light, Idle Stop & Go System (ISG) light, Preheating light, and Downhill brake control (DBC) light. These lights are also added depending on the type of engine in the vehicle.

To briefly describe these functions below:
- AEB warning light: The AEB is an emergency braking system that recognizes vehicles or pedestrians in the event of a forward collision, decelerating and mitigating damage.
- MDPS warning light: MDPS is an electric power steering, characterized by improved steering by the driving force of the motor mounted on the steering gear, the warning light is illuminated when a problem occurs.
- Mode light: This means that Eco mode and Sport mode are operating during drive mode. Sometimes the SMART phrase turns on when there is even a smart mode.
- ISG light: The idle restriction system is also referred to as the ISG and is only present on diesel vehicles. The system is equipped with a function to temporarily stop the engine when it is waiting for a signal or when it is stationary, improving fuel efficiency, suppressing emissions, and illuminating the indicator light when it is operating.
- Preheating light: The indicator light visible on diesel vehicles, illuminated when started and automatically extinguished when preheating is completed.
- DBC light: Gradient slow driving indicators are sometimes referred to as DBCs. This feature helps to drive below 10 km/h for safe driving on steep downhill roads.


## **List the Controls with the Car Dashboards**

The driver needs a variety of controls to interact with the vehicle dashboard. Basically, there are windshield wiper controls, turn signal lever, steering column, brake pedal, accelerator pedal, heating controls, and cruise control. The drivers input the functions the driver needs into the vehicle through the controls, and the problems, requirements, results, and input values that occur in the process are displayed on the dashboard to inform the driver.


## **What are some common mistakes you make with this current design**

There are many mistakes we often make with this latest design. For example, we can see how much fuel we have on the dashboard, but we can't tell exactly how much fuel we have left. Drivers often think they can reach the distance they think they can reach current fuel conditions, but they often don't. In the case of warning light, the driver often does not take them seriously when the TPMS warning light is displayed. In fact, it can operate for a considerable period of time even after the TPMS warning light is turned on. This makes drivers think little or ignore it. And this causes drivers to get hurt or spend a lot of money repairing their cars.

The dashboard enhanced the five previously described dashboards to create a new control interface. When viewing information on a dashboard, the driver's eyes should immediately be directed to the most important area, even if not necessarily located in the most visually prominent area on the screen. The tachometer and speedometer are on both sides and above, indicators related to turn signals, and other important warnings and indicators are under the array. The current gear is displayed in the center of the tachometer and the speed in the center of the speedometer is displayed in numbers. It was also easy to distinguish between engine temperatures and fuel conditions as they were shown below each other on the scale as well as on the bar graph. Time and seat belt indicators were placed based on the number 13, and the left cruise indicator and right outside temperature were numerically displayed. Adding such a variety of images and useless decorations makes the display confusing and much more difficult to interpret the meaning of the data. Consistency in display means saves time and energy by allowing the driver to use the same perceptual strategy to interpret the data. In addition to choosing the right way to present information and messages, we sought the design of components that communicate clearly and efficiently without distracting the driver. In addition, the driver's visual concentration and sense are hindered if the color is not emphasized too much or harmonized with the surroundings. Therefore, white with letters and numbers on a black background, green for headlamps, and red for important warning lights.
